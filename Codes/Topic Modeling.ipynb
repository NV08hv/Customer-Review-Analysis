I think that depends on if your child is heavy handed or not, i havent had to keep putting it back together but i could see that if a child was a bit heavy handed then you would be up and down all the time. I have taught my 2 year old to try and put it back together on her own and she can mangae to do some bits but does force them together if they are round the wrong way, but time will cure that.

The locomotive is DCCready. DCC is the digital control system for model railways allowing different trains to run at different speeds o the same tracks DCCready indicates that the loco has a socket into which a DCC module can be slotted in future the controller provided with the set is not DCCcompatible.As with all Hornby starter sets, there is sufficient track included for a simple oval circuit with a single siding and one set of points. Hornby points are a bit flimsy they don\\'t seem to click as positively into one side or the other as I remember those on the model railways of my youth doing, but the track is fine otherwise. The fishplates are reassuringly tight, and it all slots together easily. There is also a \"trackmat\" supplied, which is a rather grand name for a large printed sheet of glossy paper with a suggested layout, to make all of which requires you to buy rather a lot of extra track and accessories more a piece of marketing than anything really useful.The supplied controller is a simple rheostat you can turn the speed up and down and select forward or reverse, but it\\'s all you need to get started. If you get keen, you can buy a DCC module for the locomotive and a DCC controller to give more control options for a more sophisticated layout.Putting it all together took 20 minutes or so it\\'s reasonably obvious how you assemble it all, which is fortunate as the supplied instructions are a bit sketchy. Not really a problem, as most bits will only fit one way!Read more',\n"," 'A typical Hornby starter set. The loco is nice and sturdy and has a good weight to it, and for a \"railroad\" model the detail is very good! The Pullman coaches are equally attractive to look at, and feel as though they will last a good while. The track included, while a fairly minimal amount, is sufficient to get the set moving comfortably. The only downside in my opinion is the controller feels very cheap. I would not expect to see much use from it. However for the fact I am viewing this as simply a test model for something much larger, it will not see too much heavy use anyway. The loco runs smoothly and quietly, and I can\\'t wait to see it running on a much larger layout!',\n"," \"Great item as usual from Hornby,Loco is well detailed above Hornby's 'Railroad' versions in my opinion.A nice quality set, far too good for younger children who would easily damage, though a good starter set for the enthusiast.\",\n"," 'This is a lovely set to own and my only serious reservation is that you really need to spend quite a lot more on extras, to get the best out of it. As a starting point, it\\'s great though.The track is goodquality but does need a flat, solid base. You\\'ll need to spend time getting the creases out of the supplied 1600x1180mm \"MidiMat\" too.The detailing on the locomotive and carriages is pretty good. The conn rods move nicely and you can see inside the carriages, with their white table cloths\\' and goldcoloured lamps. It could be better still but most people will be perfectly happy with it, as I am.The box suggests all sorts of further sets to enhance this one. The Basic Oval and Track Pack A R8221 are included, to create an extended oval with a siding. Adding Track Packs B and C R8222 and R8223 gives you a double oval with siding but just one pair of points connecting them. D and E R8224 and R8225 make it really interesting, but that\\'s almost 100, so far, and you can still add F R8226 for extra sidings. Oh, and you\\'ll need a new 1800x1200 TrakMat, R8217, to go with packs E and F.Then you\\'ll want to add accessories such as stations, signal boxes and engine sheds. The message is...don\\'t imagine 150 for this set will be the end of your expenditure!Without at least the extra track, the set will be pretty dull unless you just want to go round and round in circles with the occasional foray into the siding. Hence 1 star deducted for \\'fun\\'.Some parts, notably some of the couplings, seem rather fragile. I wouldn\\'t recommend this set for younger children and would suggest 8 as an absolute minimum, and only with a lot of adult supervision. 10 or 12 would be better.Read more',\n"," 'This is the railroad version of the Duke of Gloucester which is slightly less detailed than the top of the range model and consequently less fragile. The three Pullman coaches are also from the Railroad range and do not have interior lighting as do the top of the range models.

It comes with a mat, which is actually a giant printed poster. For the long term, a hard backing is needed.The track layout feels like it is the next size up from a basic layout as it already contains an extension pack.The train itself is not huge and looks silly pulling long passenger carriages as it would on a real train.It is quite expensive and had I not seen it at a reduced price, I probably would not have bought it hence 4 5. The train can actually go quite fast in both directions. As novice I have discovered several features that must be well known to train set enthusiastsThe Trains can be tricky to get all wheels on the track. I think there is an accessory to help with thisBig Long carriages do not like tight bends at speed they come off.When using points to guide the train onto an inner circuit I bought more track you need to get jumper leads from Hornby and these are not included in Extension packs A B.Without these the train loses power, but I think they are relatively cheap.The Track needs to be cleaned with a cloth, as any grease dirt can stop the power to the trainTrain track has to be carefully aligned when joining one section to another, so continually putting it away and getting it out is time consuming setting it up on a hard backing is a better solution.My child is very careful with the set and its contents, but not an ideal present for kids who leave it lying around and step on it the carriages are expensive. I can see why people like train sets and this is a good introductory set with the plethora of accessories and trains etc from Hornby and others we were left wanting to buy more bits and pieces such as electric rather than manual points after using this set.',\n"," \"Every child should own a train set, and lately I've started suspecting that every middleaged man should have one too, so I ordered this so that me and my little lad will have a shared interest. And, if he turns out to be more interested in video games and hoverboards and whatnot, that's OK too I shall move the layout to my shed and drink homebrew alone, whilst building titchy windmills.It's nice to see, after not handling a set since the early 70s, that Hornby still maintains that quality oldschool feel, lots of detailed modelling and reassuring metal components. This starter set represents a small prewar Welsh local service, with both passenger and freight carriages, but comes with a printed landscape mat which shows you how you might extend this into a more ambitious layout.It's very difficult to find anything to criticise about this set I guess everyone knows that Hornby are the Dons of the model railway game, and the price is what it is They've always been quite expensive toys. One issue might be that most larger layouts now are apparently controlled digitally, whereas this is on an old style analogue controller, which I guess means that if you decide to build up to a set with more trains, etc, this set would have to run on a separate track?So, I'm really glad i own a trainset again, and am looking forward to spending my dotage buying tiny little tins of humbrol enamel in shades like GWR Olive Drab and staring into the windows of model shops wondering whether to invest in the 172 00H0 Village Garage with Petrol Pump.\",\n"," \"My son was purchased this train set for Christmas. My son is mad on trains and loves model train sets set up in shops, museums etc. I have never used a Hornby set before, but it is clearly well thought out, very detailed and is high quality. The first time I put it together I was surprised how fiddly it was, it certainly is not for a child to put together. The track was huge, but there is not an awful lot of variety to the set, it can be oval or circular and that's about it. It comes with a large poster of the ground that is ideal for aesthetics, but in the long term its best to be on some sort of hard backing and here is where the issue with this is. It is such a great toy, very classic, but to put it on a board is so much more complicated than it appeared for a few reasons. 1. It's huge, to put it on a board you need a dedicated space where it could be on a table or put away in some sort of bespoke contraption. We have allocated space under a double bed for the board. A chunk of MDF this size is around 1520. 2. My second idea when I realised how much floor space it takes up I thought it may be better to go up a mountain for example, but to go up you need to slope very very gradually, otherwise it climbs a bit and slides back down. I put one side sloping up using a how to train your dragon book on each side and two at the end and it couldn't climb up the far end. 3. Once you accept its going to take up a loafs of space, and once you accept it won't slope upwards much you will naturally look to add variety to the track. We looked at having the large oval with two half circles on the inside by adding 3 3rd radius double curves in two places in the middle total of 6, as well as one more left hand curve and straight and two right hand curve and straight pieces.Read more\",\n"," 'This model is something all BR modellers will want and comes at a very reasonable price for a DCC fitted loco. will definitely recommend it the seller',\n"," \"Fantastic model of a locomotive I've followed from childhood.

The body is self coloured in the right colour and the sides are lined out and lettered. The ends need to be painted black. Apart from the roof ventilators which can be glued inside the roof the whole kit clicks together ingeniously. It took about 10 mins to assemble this kit and the next will take more like 4 minutes. The only transfersdecals are the round LMS logos you can see in the centre.I don't agree with the assembly instructions! The body comprises sides ends and floor in a single piece. There is a rectangular cutout in the floor for the metal weight. I would fit the interior seat moulding into the body first. There is very little space between the compartment walls and the side of the coach to feed the flushglaze window strips in. They can't go in first Particularly on the 2nd window strip I was concerned that I might overstretch the coach side at the end and make the plastic go milky. I was relieved when the glazing clicked into the windows. At that point, with the windows correctly in place, the corridor connections can be slid in the ends and the underframe offered up to the body upside down with the metal weight located. The underframe latches actually click into the window strips to tie it all together. Likewise the roof clicks onto tabs on the window strips. Ingenious!Assembling and fitting the bogies was quite easy. The coupling retainers were fiddly though. Each coupling is plastic with a black metal hook. One of the hooks fell off. There is a C shape feature which clips onto a plastic bar and I needed to crunch it slightly with pliers, then adjust outwards with a screwdriver again until it clicked into place. The hook doesn't lift and drop as freely as it should now. It's on account of that and not being able to build the coach in the assembly instruction order without feeling I was going to break something that I've docked a star.\",\n"," \"I received this lovely train today and I am really happy with this purchase.

I've given this one 5 as opposed to the maroon one's 4 as in my opinion it looks much better in this blue and grey livery. The reviews are virtually the same apart from that rating. Presumably they lasted so long as a new buffet car cost much more than a new ordinary coach to build. It's stated on the Net that the last one was withdrawn in 1977 from Western Region use as W9135E, whilst the one depicted here, E9131E, lasted only until 1974.This model is up to the usual standard of recent Hornby coaches and, whilst a scale person wouldn't fit into the gap between the seats and tables, you must peer in through the windows to appreciate the best interior detail. It's a lovely little barcounter complete with chrome edging, an empty transparent sandwich display case, what looks like a chrome coffeemaker and one of those metal footrests running the length of the barcounter complete with the little pegs that hold it above floor level. No stools though, presumably to encourage folks to buy the curly sandwiches, overpriced drinks and then bog off back to their seats leaving it clear for more punters to part with their hardearned.There's also a representation of the handrails at the windows by the buffet barcounter to hold onto going over the points at junctions or after a few expensive tinnies which is all they used to have and still do as far as I'm aware in the beers department.Read more\",\n"," 'Fantastic.',\n"," \"My first venture into Hornby's new TTS system I only have a basic Bachmann EZ controller which can only provide functions 1 to 9 which work ok I have no idea what functions 10 to 18 do very frustrating.

We initially bought him Koko and Wilson for Christmas but could not find a Brewster to go with them, so promised him one for his birthday, then we got him the Brewster with track and tunnel set. I have to say he gets more pleasure from the trains than the tracks, which are rather fiddly to set up grownups have to do this and he doesn't seem to have grasped that you have to raise the drawbridge with the little lever if you raise it by hand, it tends to lift off the tracks so I'm constantly having to help him put it back. He also keeps switching the tunnel off for some reason. However, the toys are very sturdy, the trains in particular have been subjected to a certain amount of bashing but have withstood all ill treatment I do take them away if he gets too boisterous.The trains are beautifully made bright, sturdy, cheerful and just like their TV counterparts, with nice clear voices which are also individually distinctive. They prompt imaginative, interactive play he talks to them and makes up stories for them, and we have to stop him taking them to bed with him otherwise he would stay up all night chatting! There seems to be quite a wide range of comments between the trains, although disappointingly, only a couple of responses to the tunnel and drawbridge. The trains respond over quite a large distance, for example he has left one on the stairs and you could hear it joining in while he played with the others in the living room, so I would say at least within hearing range.

The wood is a good fine grain that does not splinter easily, and is well finished, so is safe for children to handle. It is also quite robust. A couple of minor issues. The track supports for the elevated section are rather too narrow and can fall over easily. If they were a square section they would be more stable and support the elevated pieces much better. This can be remedied by cutting duplicate supports and glueing them together to make the square cross section.

The Hornby list price is right for what you get but my budget doesn\\'t go that far so I\\'ve shopped around and found absolute bargains both on amazon and ebay sites as sellers discount their stock to get a quick sale.The train itself runs very well and although there is only one power bogie it is more than adequate to pull the whole 5 car train up the 1 in 30 inclines on my layout.The chassis is made of metal which gives extra adhesion but the real key to this is how Hornby have arranged the power collection for the lighting to run from the power car itself through the couplings to all the cars rather than collect it from each of the carriages\\' bogies. This way there is no additional friction at all from pickups which might reduce power.It runs perfectly well in either direction even though the power bogie is in one of the end driving cars.Well done Hornby and well done amazon for providing the market place where sellers can provide the discount I need.',\n"," 'very good but this is not from Una Coombs because she died over one year back',\n"," 'Great thanks! 5 stars!',\n"," 'arrived well ahead of time',\n"," 'I bought this for my 3 year old son who is obsessed with Thomas and the Trackmaster collection.

I think the finish is very good although it is a static model eg. the wheels etc. do not rotate and it is fixed to its stand which is effectively a short length of track. The real locomotive is preserved by the North Yorks Moors Railway and this replica certainly does justice to it.The model is supplied in an outer sleeve which protects a clear plastic case, in the case of my model it also has a removable thin plastic film over part of it as an additional protection.

The train set is good value for money especially when compared to the crazy prices for the DCC already installed trains!, the locomotive and carriages appear to be of a very good standard and it runs excellently so far. No regrets in buying this at all!EDIT I now have to add another negative point... though it has a happy ending. After a day or so the locomotive stuttered and stopped. It had occurred to me while it was running that it sounded a little rough compared to what it should sound like but the stoppage was quite sudden... though it did get going again it was stuttering still.

I have used most of the track to integrate it with my existing train set, and will extend it later when I buy some more points. That way I don't have any room for Track Packs E and F.The detail to the engine and the tender are very good and when it runs you can see the connecting rods moving. The three coaches are of good detail, you can see into the windows, each coach has 1st and 3rd class compartments 2nd class disappeard sometime ago and both the corridor and seats are clearly visible.Putting the train on the track took a little time and care is needed when coupling it to the coal tender and the rest of the train.I found that the Flying Scotsman does require a very flat surface to run one, and time needs to be spent getting all the creases out the base mat.As this train set is at a cost, I would not let young children play with it on their own, but under adult supervision they should be able to enjoy this train set.Read more\",\n"," 'Despite some negative reviews regarding the quality of the layout mat, we decided to take a chance and get this as a Christmas present for our 12year old son.

This on top of the high quality track, carriages and engine, it made the perfect gift.

It stands detailing and weathering well and can rapidly be made to look the part. Bagnall products were characterised by endless variety about a basic design, so small departures from scale are not really an issue.The biggest compromise on looks is with the chassis but Hornby have made the sensible decision to adopt an available, proven option. Much improvement in looks can be acheived by installing 'skirts' to cover the wheels.

Im a very well behaved young bunny with a very soft silky coat which is just waiting for you to stroke me.

I am very soft with my carefully stuffed body and have a few beans around my rear end to offer a different texture and add a little weight which makes me very huggable and squeezable too. You have probably already noticed that I am very lifelike and from a distance I could possibly be mistaken for one of those other bunnies that run and hop around with their ears swinging.Regarding my vital statistics, I measure 28cm from the tip of my nose to the base of my soft, fluffy tail, my hind legs are 15cm apart and my head is 12cm above the ground. I am childsafe but I would also be happy to play with adults too. My lopped ears are silky soft with a shorterpile fur on their underside but for some reason, they have been stitched close to my head by my breeder at Living Nature. A quick snip of the stitch holding them down has released them enabling them to swing freely and much more naturally just as I see on my larger lagomorph relatives.Although I am a very wellbred bunny, I am not quite sure about my breed and would like to keep you guessing.Read more',\n"," 'A beautiful life size and very realistic beautifully soft toy lop eared rabbit my little granddaughter who loves rabbits is delighted with it ideal toy for all who have children begging, but not quite ready or unable to have, the real thing!',\n"," 'This was bought for my daughter, who loves it.

Knocked a star off for flimsy catches, the inner felt lining for pieces felt a bit plasticky, it could do with a some kind of cover or bag for when closed up so to prevent scratches in storage the cardboard box won't last and is ugly plus the pieces could be weightier.I would have expected a little bit more in the way of little details like that for the price. I realise it's not expensive as chess sets go but my mate bought one which wasn't much different quality wise for 20 quid, although it was smaller. I guess you're paying for the size of the board and the pieces here.Other than that a great set. The new review based on knowledge I wish I had two weeks ago! Update 2 weeks later I'm feeling quite foolish about my earlier review of this set as I was clearly incredibly over forgiving of its faults. Looking back at my original comments I can see I've essentially listed features that I felt were cheap but somehow concluded that it was a great set basically on the grounds that it looked nice from a distance. I just assumed that this is how chess sets and pricing work. I was surprised by the quality when it was inspected closely but on the whole it is definitely attractive from afar. I'm happy to admit I've been more than a bit naive about chess sets and my initial impression was that this looked nice from a distance and that was all I could expect from a board at this price. Especially with the huge reduction quoted, I felt my expectations must be way out of line with the reality of dealing with quality chess sets.Read more\\\", 'I ordered these for for my Nans 100th birthday and assumed from they picture they contained some gold yellow balloons as well as other fun colours. The photo also shows them to have a slight shine and to look good quality. They have now arrived and were just loose inside an envelop, not even inside their own bag, and look really cheap and plain. No lovely colours, just cheap looking balloons. Very disappointed and do not go by the photo if like me, you are expecting some gold coloured balloons.']\",\n          \"[\\\"I ordered a 3 ring pool as described and pictured, but what I actually received was a similar looking 2 ring pool. I was not informed about this by the seller and only realised the mistake when prompted to post a review. Sending out a product of lesser value and not informing the customer, also not immediately refunding the difference is unacceptable customer service. To top it off the pool I received had a 1mm diameter hole in the top ring as a result of a manufacturing defect, so it deflated within minutes of inflating.Despite these issues the seller immediately accepted return and full refund incl. return carriage. However, to save the hassle of returning the item and being without a paddling pool for my kids essentially I still received a paddling pool, I was able to repair the hole quickly and easily with the repair patch provided and the seller agreed to refund the 2 difference between the pool I received and the one I purchased.I'm satisfied that I was able to come to an amicable agreement with the seller, but dissapointed at not receiving exactly what I ordered and not being immediately notified about it.\\\", 'Because the sand doesnt stain and is nontoxic, it is perfect for being able to play with indoors during the winter when you cant get to the beach to make proper sandcastles!I did find it relatively mess free and, any mess that was made could be swept up easily though I will only let my children play with it in the dining room where there is no carpet.I liked that the set had a good sized tray included to play with the sand. There was plenty of space in the trays to make plenty of sculptures and still left plenty of space for them to play with the sand. I would have liked to have seen lids for the trays to be able to store the sand easier.The quality of the plastic modelling tools provided is great. The plastic is strong and will stand up to a lot of play.Although Sands Alive claims to look and feel like real sand I dont really agree. It definitely feels more like a modelling sand than real sand which is not a bad thing. It does, however, look more like sand than other sets we have had in the past as it is sand coloured.My 7 year old son found the sand very easy to model both with his hands and with the moulds provided.

I realise it's not expensive as chess sets go but my mate bought one which wasn't much different quality wise for 20 quid, although it was smaller. I guess you're paying for the size of the board and the pieces here.Other than that a great set. The new review based on knowledge I wish I had two weeks ago! Update 2 weeks later I'm feeling quite foolish about my earlier review of this set as I was clearly incredibly over forgiving of its faults. Looking back at my original comments I can see I've essentially listed features that I felt were cheap but somehow concluded that it was a great set basically on the grounds that it looked nice from a distance. I just assumed that this is how chess sets and pricing work. I was surprised by the quality when it was inspected closely but on the whole it is definitely attractive from afar. I'm happy to admit I've been more than a bit naive about chess sets and my initial impression was that this looked nice from a distance and that was all I could expect from a board at this price.

Also wheels are too wide for our other wooden track, the Thomas Track has slightly wider tracks than brio, ikea etc.So pretty useless.', 'These new \"improved\" engines are pretty poor. Yes, they are faster, but due to the changed drive wheels the tread is more spaced out, formed of little spikes the new engines can\\'t pull many carriages. Worse, they can\\'t go over the flexi track or the straight pieces of track designed to be used in stations. There just isn\\'t enough friction between the new wheels and those types of track since the surface of the track is smoother. Gordon does work fine on the standard track, but my son always uses flexi track and stations in the tracks he builds.I have a very disappointed 4 year old he\\'d been saving his stickers for a while to get Gordon and would advise against buying any of these new engines. We won\\'t be getting any more untilunless the design fault is rectified.', 'If the Government passed a law that specified a certain type of new tyre, and we all had to change our cars because of it, how would we feel? They seem to have done something similar with the Thomas Trackmaster engines! If you read any of the reviews for the various engines you will find people saying the newer engines with the ribbed tyres don\\'t work on layouts using the existing track. Is there any new track that they do work with? Well, there is the new \"Revolution\" grey track with ribs but it\\'s not very evident on the market. The most common track seems to be the beige plastic one that everybody has. The problem is that the newer engines don\\'t cross the points on a curve. They will just about struggle over points on a straight. The track needs to be free of bumps too. The new ribbed grey rails are found in \"addon\" kits at present, and mostly involve steep ascents and fast drops. They say they fit on to the older beige rails, but that means the new engines are expected to work on the beige rails, and, as so many people can tell you, they just don\\'t unless modified.I know people often like to \"give and forget\" when it comes to children\\'s toys, but there is a problem when a toy doesn\\'t work as expected, and in this case it gets quite technical. All of the engines have a raised part on the base, and this is to facilitate the use of things like \"riser\" rails that can be used to stop a train at the station by moving a lever I\\'ve read about these, but have never seen any for sale. The newer type of engine has ribbed tyres on the wheels, and the wheels are smaller in diameter but the raised rib on the bottom is actually higher than in the previous model of engine.
